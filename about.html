        <p id="tag"> This site will present you to a cultural adventure which reflects the cultural mentality to its fullest.
            The Persona site tour will leave you with a feeling you were a part of the tour and not an outsider taking a look.
            At the tourist places, there is a rare atmosphere, it can't be described only felt.</p>

        <p class="travel">What sets Persona Tours apart is the individual attention given to each client, on each tour.  Not only do we create most of the itineraries, we make ourselves accessible during the entire booking process including escorting the actual tour! Persona Tours' Mission is to provide planned, escorted tours inclusive of transportation, hotel, meals, and admissions.  Each tour offers the flexibility of traveling as a group, with options to explore some on their own.  Either way, your Tour Escort is with you every step of the way to provide security, ease, and peace of mind.</p>
